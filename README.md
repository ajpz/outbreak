### What is it?
Outbreak is a port of the popular collaborative boardgame, 'Pandemic'. In this game, you work together as a team to prevent the spread of 4 deadly infections that are spreading unpredictably across the world. Instead of typical games where players are trying to beat each other, Pandemic emphasizes collaboration for all players. The goal is to cure the world of infections and the infections are spreading each turn. Each player has a special ability and it will be up to all the players to use those abilities effectively to save the world.
Play the game at http://www.playoutbreak.com/

### How to play
The best way to play this game is to create an account and have a friend join in on the fun. The minimum number of players is 2 and the max is 4. Once you create a game and have the number of players to play, all players will be sent to the board game map. If you know how to play and it's your turn, you can start picking your actions right away. However, if you need a refresher on how to play, click on our rules manual at the bottom of the game screen.
